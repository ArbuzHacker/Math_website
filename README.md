How to add your problem solution?
all of the solutions should be placed in the folder pages with following structure:
/pages/your_site_name/your_site_name.html
js, css and any other files also should be placen in there

in order for LaTEx to be rendered you have to add a script, like in zadanie_3. the script will render only parts with 'id="math"', so text that does not have to be rendered should not be included with this tag, as current interpreter does not suppor polish characters very well. If you are having trubble please look at other files for guadience.
