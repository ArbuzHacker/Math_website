This is a school project
use it however you want



all of the solutions should be placed in the folder pages with following structure:
/pages/your_site_name/your_site_name.html
js, css and any other files also should be placen in there

in order for LaTEx to be rendered you have to add a script, like in zadanie_3. the script will render only parts with 'id="math"', so text that does not have to be rendered should not be included with this tag, as current interpreter does not suppor polish characters very well. It is also having truble with reading parts writen like "\( some content here )\". to fix this remove unnecessary ( or ) and look into the browsers console (F12) where an error message is displayed. If you are having trubble please look at other files for guadience.
